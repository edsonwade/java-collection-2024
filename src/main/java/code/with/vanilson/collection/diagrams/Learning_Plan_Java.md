# 4-Week Java Learning Plan

## Overview

- **Daily Study Time**: 1.5 - 2 hours on weekdays, 3 - 4 hours on weekends.
- **Total Duration**: 4 weeks.
- **Goal**: Strengthen Java programming skills, including core Java concepts, OOP, data structures, and algorithms.

## Week 1: Deepening Core Java Knowledge

- **Monday to Friday**:
    - **Focus**: Review basic Java concepts (variables, loops, conditionals, arrays).
    - **Daily Goal**: 1.5 hours of review and practice.

- **Saturday**:
    - **Focus**: Java classes, objects, constructors, and methods.
    - **Daily Goal**: 3 hours of learning and implementation.

- **Sunday**:
    - **Focus**: Practice with small programs.
    - **Daily Goal**: 3 hours on a mini-project (e.g., a basic calculator).

## Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Monday to Friday**:
    - **Focus**: OOP principles (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction).
    - **Daily Goal**: 1.5 hours of study and exercises.

- **Saturday**:
    - **Focus**: Small OOP-based project (e.g., library management system).
    - **Daily Goal**: 4 hours coding and testing.

- **Sunday**:
    - **Focus**: Review and refactor the project.
    - **Daily Goal**: 3 hours refining code and understanding OOP.

## Week 3: Data Structures and Algorithms

    - **Daily Goal**: 2 hours of study and implementation.

- **Saturday**:
    - **Focus**: Sorting and searching algorithms.
    - **Daily Goal**: 3 hours on algorithms like bubble sort and binary search.

- **Sunday**:
    - **Focus**: Practice coding problems.
    - **Daily Goal**: 3 hours solving problems on coding platforms.

## Week 4: Application and Project Work

- **Monday to Friday**:
    - **Focus**: Apply concepts to a larger project (e.g., inventory management system).
    - **Daily Goal**: 2 hours working on the project.

- **Saturday**:
    - **Focus**: Finalize the project.
    - **Daily Goal**: 4 hours to complete and test the project.

- **Sunday**:
    - **Focus**: Review and reflect on the learning journey.
    - **Daily Goal**: 3 hours reviewing and planning the next steps.
